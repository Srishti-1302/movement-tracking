# movement-tracking

### Description
This is a face movement tracking application that can convert face movement into keyboard commands like UP - DOWN - LEFT - RIGHT. I used facial landmarks to detect face and get the nose out of it for better referencing. 

### Fun with face movements
Open any online game on the browser which needs UP-DOWN-LEFT-RIGHT movements following games, you can find many games if you search on google.
